# **CrowdStacks: The Story**

CrowdStacks was created to solve a major problem in indie game crowdfunding: a lack of trust. Many campaigns fail to deliver a finished game, leaving backers with nothing to show for their support. Our platform solves this by ensuring accountability through the use of smart contracts.

**How it Works:** Funds are held in escrow on the Stacks blockchain and are only released to developers when they hit pre-defined milestones.

**For Backers:** This model gives you more security. Your contribution is protected and won't be used until a developer shows concrete progress.

**For Developers:** This allows you to build trust with the community and demonstrate you are committed to the project.

## **The Platform**

CrowdStacks is built on the Stacks blockchain, providing a secure and transparent system.

## **Quick Start**

You'll need a few things to get started:

* Node.js 18+
* Docker Desktop
* Clarinet CLI (install with `npm install -g @hirosystems/clarinet`)

## **Installation**

**Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

**Start the local devnet:**

```bash
cd contracts && clarinet integrate
```

**Launch the frontend:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Access the DApp at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**.

## **Testing**

You can run automated tests or use the console to interact with the smart contracts.

**Run tests:**

```bash
npm test
```

**Use the console:**

```bash
cd contracts && clarinet console
```

**Call a function:**

```clarity
(contract-call? .crowdfunding contribute u5000000)
```

## **Project Structure**

* `/contracts/`: Clarity smart contracts and tests.
* `/app/`: The Next.js frontend application.
* `/components/`: Reusable UI components.
* `/lib/`: Blockchain helpers and configuration.
* `/public/`: Static assets.

## **Demo Workflow**

1. Start the local blockchain with Clarinet.
2. Launch the frontend.
3. Create a new campaign.
4. Contribute STX to the campaign.
5. Wait for the milestone goal to be met.
6. Withdraw funds (if successful) or request a refund.
